# Gene-Expression-Classifier-with-Autoencoder
High-dimensional gene expression data (10,000+ features) poses serious challenges in modeling due to noise, redundancy, and overfitting. This project simulates such data and uses an autoencoder to extract meaningful latent representations, followed by a classifier to predict disease classes.
